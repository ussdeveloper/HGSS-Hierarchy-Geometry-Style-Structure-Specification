# GeoPackage Sample

GeoPackage is an SQLite-based format for geospatial data. This is a placeholder - actual conversion would require SQLite database handling.

Example tables:
- features: Contains geometry and attributes
- styles: Optional styling information

For actual implementation, use a GeoPackage library to read/write SQLite databases.
